This is a Restaurant Review project in stage 1. It shows a list of restaurants with their details. Each restaurant is a links directly to display all the reviews on it. This project also has an interactive map, with zoom-in, zoom-out, and full screen view features. All the restaurants are marked on this map.
Additionally, the restaurant list can be filtered based on cuisines and neighborhood.


### Specification

This project is responsive and can be rendered on any device and viewport ranging from a mobile to a standard desktop. Accessibility has also been incorporated to enable aids such as screen reader and users with partial vision impairments.
Service Workers have also been added which store the visited data in a cache which can be accessed in absence of internet connectivity while still maintaining its functionality.


### How to start?
1. Download or clone all the files. start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.



### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
